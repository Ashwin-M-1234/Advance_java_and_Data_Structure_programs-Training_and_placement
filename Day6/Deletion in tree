#Deletion....
  Whenever a node is to be deleted from a binary search tree, one of the three possibilities may arise
    (a) The node to be deleted is a leaf node(i.e. it has no child nodes)
    (b)The node to be deleted has only one child node
       Copy the child node’s data into the node and then delete the child node from the binary search tree.
    (c)The node to be deleted has two children nodes
       Find the in-order successor of the node, copy the content’s of the in-order successor into the node and then remove the in-order successor from the binary search tree.
