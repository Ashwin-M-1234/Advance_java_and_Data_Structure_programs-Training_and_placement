1. Our knowledge and abilities are put to the test in the final exams, which require us to construct and use sophisticated data structures
   like linked lists, binary trees, graphs, and hash tables.

2. Additionally, our capacity to assess the time and spatial complexity of algorithms and offer the best solutions to various issues was assessed.

3. The tests included coding tasks, written exams, and occasionally even real-world applications. In order to pass, we had to show that we could implement data structures in languages like C, Java, or Python.

4. These coding tasks frequently gave us real-world situations to address, forcing us to choose the best data structure and technique.

5. Our theoretical knowledge of data structures, including concepts like searching, sorting, recursion, and dynamic programming, was put to the test in the tests.

6. Written exams, coding challenges, and occasionally even practical applications were all part of the testing.

7. We had to demonstrate our ability to implement data structures in languages like C, Java, or Python in order to pass.

8. These code assignments regularly presented us with real-world problems to solve, requiring us to select the optimal data structure and method.

9. The assessments tested our theoretical understanding of data structures, covering ideas like searching, sorting, recursion, and dynamic programming.
